[asebaros] is a bridge between [Aseba] and [ROS].
It allows to load source code, inspect the network structure, read and write variables, and send and receive events from [ROS].
It maps the [Aseba] named events to [ROS] topics in a dynamic way, when loading source code.
[asebaros] will compile on platforms supported by [ROS].
